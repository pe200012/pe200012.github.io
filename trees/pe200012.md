I am a second-year master student in the [Department of Mathematical and Computing Science](https://educ.titech.ac.jp/is/) at the Institute of Science Tokyo, advised by Professor [Masuhara Hidehiko](https://prg.is.titech.ac.jp/ja/people/masuhara/).

I prefer functional programming and am currently learning programming language theory. Particularly, algebraic effects, continuations, dependent types, formal verification, and type theories.
